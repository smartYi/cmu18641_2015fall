When you unzip this folder, you will see following subfolders and documents;

Class_relationship_diagram.png

yiq_assignment is the java projects; test_output.txt file is the test results of my experiments for this project;
Assignment_Class_diagram is the class relationship drawn by hand before coding. (Of course some revisements are done during the coding process)
The final document is the Readme.txt file which is exactly the one you are reading.

3: How to run the source code

When you try to run the source code in the Eclipse (version 1.8 is needed), two steps are involved;

1): You should import the whole java project, that is yiq_assignment into the Eclipse;
2): Then you find the test.java file and run this file, you can get the accordingly result in the console.

Attention: Since three cases are tested in this project, so when you test one case you should comment the other two cases in case of error.
