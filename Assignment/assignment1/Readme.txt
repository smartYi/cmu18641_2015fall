versionâ€”1.0

**Attention: This source code is based on java SE-1.8. You may not run this code if your java version is lower than 1.8.

1: What is the source code for?

This is the folder of assignment1 for the course 18641--Java Smart Phone Development.

2: Important subfolders and documents

When you unzip this folder, you will see following subfolders and documents;

Assignment1_Class-diagram.pdf ParkingSimulator
Coin                          Readme.txt
Manual_class_diagram.pdf      test_output.txt

Coin and ParkingSimulator are the java projects; test_output.txt file is the test results of my experiments for both part a and part b;
Assignment_Class_diagram is the class relationship drawn by Eclipse while the Manual_class_diagram.pdf is the class relationship drawn 
by hand before coding. (Of course some reivisements are done during the coding process)
The final document is the Readme.txt file which is exactly the one you are reading.

3: How to run the source code

When you try to run the source code in the Eclipse (version 1.8 is needed), two steps are involved;

1): You should import the whole java project into the Eclipse;
2): Then you find the test.java file and run this file, you can get the accordingly result in the console.

Attention: Since two projects are included in this assignment and I set them to be two separate java projects. So you must import java 
projects twice that is Coin project and ParkingSimulator project.
