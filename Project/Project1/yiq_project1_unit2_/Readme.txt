version—1.0

**Attention: This source code is based on java SE-1.8. You may not run this code if your java version is lower than 1.8.
***Attention: Carefully read the documentation and it will give you a overall view of this  whole project. 

1: What is the source code for?

This is the folder of project-unit2 for the course 18641--Java Smart Phone Development.

2: Important subfolders and documents

When you unzip this folder, you will see following subfolders and documents;

1)yiq_project1_unit2_partA (Part A project)
2)yiq_project1_unit2_partA (Part B project)
3)Readme.txt
4)Documentation.pdf
5)Class_relationship_diagram.png
6)partA_test_output.txt
7)partB_test_output.txt

yiq_project1_unit2_partA and yiq_project1_unit2_partB are the java projects for part A and part B in this unit2; partA_test_output.txt and partB_test_output.txt file are the test results of my experiments for this project;
Class_relationship_diagram is the class relationship;
Documentation.pdf provides an overall view of this project and what is this source code for;
The final document is the Readme.txt file which is exactly the one you are reading.

Since yiq_project1_unit2_partA and yiq_project1_unit2_partB contains the same files and folders, next yiq_project1_unit2_partA will be explained.
When you open yiq_project1_unit2_partA, you will find:

Blank.txt        FordZTW2.txt     doc
ExceptionLog.txt ZTW.ser          relationship.mgc
FordZTW.txt      bin (folder)     src (Folder)

Blank.txt is an empty input file and is to test BlankFile exception; FordZTW2.txt is another input file, but in this file there are some errors that will call exceptions; ExceptionLog.txt is a file that record the called exceptions and their timestamps; ZTW.ser is the serialization file; relationship.mgc is relationship between classes and you can ignore it here; FordZTW.txt is the complete input file that won’t call any exceptions. 

3: How to run the source code

When you try to run the source code in the Eclipse (version 1.8 is needed), two steps are involved;

1): You should import the whole java project. For part A and part B, I set different projects folders, which means you should import twice.
2): Then you find the driver package and locate the driver.java file and run this file, you can get the accordingly result in the console.
